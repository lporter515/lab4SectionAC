# Exercise 7: DPLYR practice with NBA data
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# Read in the NBA team data of the 2016-2017 season from the data directory
# into a variable called `team.data` using `read.csv`

team.data <- read.csv("data/teams.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# The data.frame team.data should now be accessible to you.
# View it, and get some basic information about the number of rows/columns.
# Note the "X" preceding some of the column titles as well as the "*"
# following the names of teams that made it to the playoffs that year.

View(team.data)

# Add a column that gives the turnovers to steals ratio (TOV / STL) for each team

team.data <- mutate(team.data, turns_steals_ratio= TOV / STL)

# Sort the teams from lowest turnover/steal ratio to highest

-- use an arrange function!

#Find the average BLK and STL for teams having a TOV greater than the average TOV of all teams

-- 2 parts, find the AVG BLK And STL teams
-- First filter, then find AVG

# Get the team that had the highest Total Rebounds (TRB) only with the columns
# Team and TRB  *using one line of code*

-- order from highest to lowert and and get the name on top and return!

# Print only the name of the team that had the highest total rebounds
# (that also happens to be the greatest team of all time)


## Let's change gears!

# Read in the Pokemon data from the data directory
# into a variable called `pokemon` using `read.csv`. Remember to not read strings in as factors.

# First, View() the data set to see what info you have to work with


# Find all the Pokemon that are "Water" or "Ghost" Type 1 and have a speed higher than 50

-- Filter type 1 and see if water or ghost and also check if > 50 and set to new variable

# Find the average HP, median HP, min HP and max HP for each of the type of generations

-- Group the tables in terms to generations (GROUP BY),
-- USER summarize function to find avg. min, max

#FIND THE NUMBER OF POKEMONS THAT ARE LEGENDARY AND THE NUMBER OF POKEMONS THAT ARE NOT LEGENDARY
#THAT HAVE A HIGHER ATTACK THAN DEFENSE VALUE
#NOTE: IT SHOULD BE DONE IN ONE RUN OF DPLYR
#HINT : Look into count() function by dplyr

-- Filter if they are legendary, then mutate finding if attack is greater than their defense

#Find the generation that has the most number of pokemons with Type.1 as "Fire"

-- grouping by generations, filter based on type 1

# WHICH Type 1 pokemon has the overall within group max value of SUM of HP, Attack, Defense, Sp..Att, Sp.Def, Speed
#HINT : LOOK AT THE DATASET! - THERE IS A SUPER EASY WAY TO DO THIS.

-- Group by for type 1! then summarize seeing sum of children, then filter to find max, and select!
